
# Basic Roller
A open source web app highly customizable dice roller and stat tracker(possible roll 20 competitor one day). Allows users to input character details and allows them to focus on RPing instead of the math keeping the world fair. Built with next.js, tauri and sqlite.

## Status
Currently very much a work in progress. Currently on Hiatus because I need to broaden my horizon for languages prior to my internship. Will likely return to this project when I am in a more stable place and can devote time to the constant feature creep DnD provides. See screen shots
